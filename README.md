HTML5-Storybook
===============

The PBS KIDS HTML5 Storybook Engine allows users to rapidly develop cross-platform interactive storybooks with animations and audio.

Some examples of stories developed with the engine are:

Daniel Tiger's [Something Special For Dad](http://pbskids.org/daniel/stories/something-special-for-dad/)

PBS KIDS [Writer's Contest](http://pbskids.org/writerscontest/read-stories)

[Daniel's Babysitter](http://pbskids.org/daniel/stories/daniels-babysitter/) 




The engine was developed in 2012-2013 for PBS KIDS by [William Malone](http://willaimmalone.com).

This engine is free to use (see license.txt), all assets in the example book are (c) William Malone.
